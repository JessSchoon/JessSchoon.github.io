        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p> I am apparently part of Gen Y, a millenial,  a member of the boomerang generation. I am supposed to overshare and be impatient. I may do the former, but hopefully have prevented the latter. I am supposed to need extrinsic   motivation and rewards in order to perform. </p>
        <p>
            I must have been born in the wrong generation, because I think my family breaks the mold. My husband and I were born the same year and have both been called "Sharks". We aren't willing to just be happy with the way things are (mostly in what we have learned). We like to learn then teach. We like to be independent and push ourselves beyond what we think we can do. Our motto is "Do nothing halfway."
        </p>
        <p>
            While following through with our motto we have moved cross country multiple times and were blessed with children 13 months apart. Our adventures continue as we continue to learn and push ourselves, each other, our children, and hopefully you to be successful in ways they didn't think possible.
